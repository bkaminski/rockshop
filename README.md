Custom WordPress theme developed exclusively for The Rockshop

The Rockshop is one of Delaware's premiere venues for live entertainment in the Dover area. The purpose of this build was to create a custom WordPress theme that acted as an event calendar.

To do this, I created some custom query loops to use future or scheduled posts as "events". In fact, all posts act as "events" in this build.

The cool thing about this theme is that the date after the event passes, it's removed from the homepage loop and placed in the archive loop. Fun stuff!

Nothing too complicated here, just a customization of WordPress to allow the main blog to act as an event calendar by giving permission to show scheduled posts, enable term taxonomy to render future post tags, and include tags and metadata in the site search regardless of post status.

So far so good!
